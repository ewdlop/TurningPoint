# TurningPoint

It seems like you're asking about New Jersey roadways, possibly regarding jughandle turns, reconfigured intersections, or changes to parkways. Could you clarify your question? For example, are you asking for:

1. The design and purpose of **jughandle turns** in New Jersey?  
2. Updates or construction projects affecting **parkways** in New Jersey?  
3. Guidelines for **handling new roadway maneuvers**?  
4. Something else entirely?

Let me know, and I'll assist!

The **Reidemeister moves** come from knot theory and are used to manipulate knot diagrams without changing the fundamental topology of the knot. If you're metaphorically linking Reidemeister moves to highways or roadways, it could imply visualizing or reconfiguring complex pathways, intersections, or traffic flows in a way that preserves continuity and structure.

Hereâ€™s a creative interpretation for highways:

1. **Reidemeister Move 1 (Twist/Untwist):**  
   Represents loops or sharp curves in highways that can be added or removed (e.g., roundabouts or highway loops being modified).

2. **Reidemeister Move 2 (Add/Remove Crossing):**  
   Suggests creating or removing overpasses, underpasses, or flyovers to simplify or alter the flow of traffic.

3. **Reidemeister Move 3 (Slide Crossing):**  
   Reflects realigning intersecting roads or ramps for smoother transitions, akin to reconfiguring traffic flows without introducing new bottlenecks.

This metaphorical lens could be applied to civil engineering or urban planning to rethink and redesign complex traffic systems while ensuring they remain functionally equivalent.

If this is what you're hinting at, or if you have a specific context, let me know!
